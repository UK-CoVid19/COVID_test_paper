This repository contains the initial literature review for this publication. The document is formatted in latex to make it to format the citations. The folder contains the finished .pdf for review and commenting. The original .tex and .bib files are included for building. The easiest way to build the document is to use sublime text. It usually autodetects .tex files and `cmd` + `b` will build the .pdf file.
